		Why is the shipping free? Is there something different about these chocolates?
	</li>
	<ol start="1" type="a">
		<li>
			The chocolates are exactly the same type, quality, and freshness as Studio Chocolate&rsquo;s regular
			bonbon collection boxes. Shipping is free because each Hybrid Gift has to be ordered on its own.
			And we don&rsquo;t want multiple shipping fees to stop you from ordering anything else that catches
			your fancy!

		My browser warns me that the <a href="http://hybridgifting.com" target="_blank">hybridgifting.com</a>
		site is not secure. Is this a scam?
	</li>
	<ol start="1" type="a">
		<li>
			Secure websites primarily protect personal and financial data, like your name, address, and credit card
			number. The only information that goes through <a href="http://hybridgifting.com" target="_blank">hybridgifting.com</a>
			is the digital content you upload and your order number. Even these are very securely stored on the
			University of Nottingham servers. We can provide you with details, if you like, via the contact email
			below. Rest assured that nothing else goes through this website, and it never interacts with the Studio
			Chocolate website.

	<li class="quest">
		Why can&rsquo;t my Hybrid Gift be shipped immediately? I need it to arrive right away!
	</li>
	<ol start="1" type="a">
		<li>
			Hybrid Gifts can be shipped as soon as you, the gift-giver, go to
			<a href="http://hybridgifting.com" target="_blank">http://hybridgifting.com</a>
			and make the digital part of the gift.
			<br>
			This is to help prevent disappointment and frustration from you and your gift-receiver. If something
			urgent comes up in your life, and the gift ships faster than expected, your receiver will be excited
			to see what you gave them â€“ and find an empty digital gift. We don&rsquo;t want anyone to end up in that
			predicament.
			<br>
			You might want to spend a long time choosing or making the perfect combination of media, but you don&rsquo;t
			have to.
			<br>
			If you have a particular reason that you need your gift to ship right away, please contact
			<a href="mailto:orders@studio-chocolate.co.uk" target="_blank">orders@studio-chocolate.co.uk</a>.
			We will work with them to help you out if at all possible, but we can&rsquo;t make any promises.

			<a href="http://hybridgifting.com" target="_blank">hybridgifting.com</a> is a website owned and run by
			members of the Mixed Reality Lab, a technology research lab at the University of Nottingham. Hybrid Gifting
			is a research project funded by UKRI/EPSRC. You can find out about it and UKRI/EPSRC at the University&rsquo;s
			own page on this project,
			<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mixedrealitylab/projects/hybrid-gifting.aspx"

			Studio Chocolate is working in partnership with us to help discover more about how to combine physical
			and digital gifts. Our top priority is to support Studio Chocolate, and the best way to do that is not
			to interfere with their customer information &ndash; your personal information, especially your credit card
			details.
			<br>
			This is why we have a completely separate website for making digital gifts. The University and <a
				href="http://hybridgifting.com" target="_blank">hybridgifting.com</a> have no way of interacting
			with Studio Chocolate&rsquo;s website or any of the information they store to bring you your delicious
			chocolates!
