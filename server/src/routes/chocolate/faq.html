		Why is the shipping free? Is there something different about these chocolates?
		<ol start="1" type="a">
			<li>
				The chocolates are exactly the same type, quality, and freshness as Studio Chocolate&rsquo;s regular
				bonbon collection boxes. Shipping is free because each Hybrid Gift has to be ordered on its own.
				And we don&rsquo;t want multiple shipping fees to stop you from ordering anything else that catches
				your fancy!

		Why can&rsquo;t my Hybrid Gift be shipped immediately? I need it to arrive right away!
		<ol start="1" type="a">
			<li>
				Hybrid Gifts can be shipped as soon as you, the gift-giver, go to
				<a href="https://hybridgifting.com" target="_blank">https://hybridgifting.com</a>
				and make the digital part of the gift.
				<br>
				This is to help prevent disappointment and frustration from you and your gift-receiver. If something
				urgent comes up in your life, and the gift ships faster than expected, your receiver will be excited
				to see what you gave them – and find an empty digital gift. We don&rsquo;t want anyone to end up in that
				predicament.
				<br>
				You might want to spend a long time choosing or making the perfect combination of media, but you don&rsquo;t
				have to.
				<br>
				If you have a particular reason that you need your gift to ship right away, please contact
				<a href="mailto:orders@studio-chocolate.co.uk" target="_blank">orders@studio-chocolate.co.uk</a>.
				We will work with them to help you out if at all possible, but we can&rsquo;t make any promises.

		What if I want to change or add to my gift?

				If you have just finished, click your browser’s ‘back’ button until you see the ‘submit’ link. Then make
				your changes and submit again. If you have left the page, return to hybridgifting.com and log in using
				your invoice number and password. Then make your changes and submit again. Usually, though, as soon as
				you can see your upload, so can your receiver.

	<li class="quest">
		What if I can’t remember my password?
		<ol start="1" type="a">
			<li>
				Email <a href="mailto:support@hybridgifting.com">support@hybridgifting.com</a> with your invoice number
				and we will arrange a new password for you.
				(Please bear with us! In order to protect your personal data held by Studio Chocolate, this research
				project cannot use an automated ‘reset password’ service. This means actual humans helping you out, so
				please give us 24-48 hours to respond.)

		<ol start="1" type="a">
			<li>
				<a href="https://hybridgifting.com" target="_blank">hybridgifting.com</a> is a website owned and run by
				members of the Mixed Reality Lab, a technology research lab at the University of Nottingham. Hybrid
				Gifting
				is a research project funded by UKRI/EPSRC. You can find out about it and UKRI/EPSRC at the University&rsquo;s
				own page on this project,
				<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mixedrealitylab/projects/hybrid-gifting.aspx"
				   target="_blank">
					https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/&#8203;research/groups/&#8203;mixedrealitylab/projects/&#8203;hybrid-gifting.aspx</a>.
				<br>
				Studio Chocolate is working in partnership with us to help discover more about how to combine physical
				and digital gifts. Our top priority is to support Studio Chocolate, and the best way to do that is not
				to interfere with their customer information &ndash; your personal information, especially your credit
				card
				details.
				<br>
				This is why we have a completely separate website for making digital gifts. The University and <a
					href="https://hybridgifting.com" target="_blank">hybridgifting.com</a> have no way of interacting
				with Studio Chocolate&rsquo;s website or any of the information they store to bring you your delicious
				chocolates!
